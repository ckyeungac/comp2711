This is a program to entering the attendance score.

Idea:
First prompt the window to add what function a user needed.

```
(a) Add new entry
(q) quit
```

After pressing 'a', it will prompt

```
Entry name: 
```

After entering the 'entry name', it will keep prompting the following message to type in the last-4 digit of the student id
```
Last 4 digits of student id [or quit (q)]: 
```

It will ask you to enter the full student ID when duplicated record found:
```
"More than one students found:"
...
"Enter the full student id: "
```

After you press `q`, the program will ask you the filename you would like to save:
```
save to file with name: 
```
